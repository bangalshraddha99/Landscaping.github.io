          <p id="p1">What is Garden Development?</p>
          <p id="k1">Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture. 
              In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal or cosmetic use.
              Gardening is considered by many people to be a relaxing activity. There are also many studies about the positive effects on mental and physical
               health in relation to gardening.Specifically, gardening is thought to increase self-esteem and 
               reduce stress.As writer and former teacher Sarah Biddle notes, one's garden may become a "tiny 
               oasis to relax and recharge batteries.Services also include basic gardening tasks, such as planting perennials, annuals, shrubs, and trees, lawn and garden maintenance services like mowing, pruning, and 
               fertilizing, as well as disposal services, like removing brush and other debris.</p>
          <p id="p2">What is Landscaping?</p>
          <p id="k2">Landscaping is a task that combines science and art. Armed with horticultural knowledge, as well as familiarity with the elements and principles of landscape design,
               a landscape professional can help you transform your property. 
               These can include transplanting or pruning shrubs, spraying for weeds, cutting branches off trees, managing flower beds, installing walking paths and lighting and prepping lawns in fall and spring
                by thatch raking, aerating and applying seed and fertilizer.
                There are different types of landscape:
                Mountain landscapes. We can see mountains, with narrow rivers, forests, villages and steep roads.
                Flat landscapes. We can see flat land, wide rivers, farms, cities and motorways.
                Coastal landscapes. We can see cliffs, the sea and tourist towns.</p>
          <p id="p3">What we do?</p>
          <div class="ser">
              <ul>
              <li>SIMPLICITY</li>
              <li>Elements that do not provide improvement or impact on the design can be omitted. Prioritize what is important and what is not in order to keep the design clean, neat and uncluttered.
                A simple, well-defined design is one that will be easier to maintain and increase functionality.</li>
              <li>VARIETY</li>
              <li>Shape, size and form selections should be diverse in order to create visual interest. However, do not forfeit simplicity merely to create varied combinations.</li>
              <li>BALANCE</li>
              <li>Everything that is placed in a design will carry a certain visual weight with it. Balance is the concept of ensuring the weight feels even throughout the plan.
                A plan with formal balance will have both sides mirroring each other, while informal balance refers to equal but not matching. Both can work well.</li>
              <li>EMPHASIS</li>
              <li>Accentuating parts of the design using texture, form or color will provide interest and lead the eye through the design, however, too much emphasis will feel chaotic.
                Specimen areas are best standing alone. Accent areas are meant to stand out, but within the context of a larger design. Key plants can help to deemphasize or soften architectural features.</li>
              <li>SEQUENCE</li>
              <li>Sequence refers to how transitions in the elements of plant size, shape and texture are used. Gradual changes of one element at a time offer a smooth, appealing sequence. 
                Abrupt changes from a tall plant to a short one or a fine-textured plant to a rough one do not work well.</li>
              <li>SCALE / PROPORTION</li>
              <li>The size of the components in a landscape is scale and how they relate to each other is proportion. â€‹The size of your landscape and the items in it should all be balanced. A wall or tree that is significantly larger that everything else will pull the eye away from the rest of the garden.</li>
              <li>UNITY</li>
              <li>Unity is the concept that everything works together. Interconnection is gaining unity by using connections such as paths, walkways, stairs and fences to physically link areas.
                Repetition is when an aspect of design is unifying because it occurs in several areas. Repetition can be helpful but take care not to overuse it. Dominance is when other areas appear to unify in support a single focal point, perhaps a large tree.</li>
